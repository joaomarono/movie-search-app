## Movie Search APP 🎥 👨‍💻

The main idea is to create an application where you can search for movies and select what you want to create a favorite list of movies.
After you select one movie the id is added to the cookie. Later, when you access your favorite movie list we extract the id's from the cookie and make a request to the movie api so we can extract some informations from the movies we got. We can "check" if we already see the movie by clicking in a green button inside the movie component.

API: https://www.themoviedb.org/

What i have learned: 
 - Working with a API
 - Working with cookies
 - Using useEffect and useState
 - Material UI framework for the menu
 - React Components
